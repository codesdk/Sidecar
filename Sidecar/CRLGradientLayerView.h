 CRLGradientLayerView is a UIView subclass with CAGradientLayer as its layerClass, and features several
 helpers to make it easier to manipulate the gradient.
 
 Note that the backgroundColor and gradientColors of this view are mutually exclusive: setting
 gradientColors results in a backgroundColor of [UIColor clearColor], and setting backgroundColor
 results in gradientColors being set to nil.
